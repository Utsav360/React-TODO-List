# React-TODO-List
This is React TODO List Single Page Application created with ReactJS, create-react-app, and ReactRouter. IT has total 4 Pages(Home, TODO, Contact, and About Page).

The TODO page should present the user with a “to do” list.  The to do list can either be a list (ordered or unordered) or a table format, or even some other format, so long as it is a vertical list of items.  The to do list should initially have a few items present that you have hardcoded into your solution (“walk the dog”, “pick up laundry”).  

Above the to do list you should have a form with an input text box and a submit button with the text “add”.  When the user enters a new item into the input text box and clicks on add, the new item should be inserted into the to do list, and the input text box should be set to blank.   

Each item in the to do list should have a delete link either to the left or the right of the item (maybe the text “D” or a delete icon, it’s up to you).  When the user clicks on the delete link, the item should be removed from the to do list. 

Each item in the to do list should have an edit link either to the left or the right of the item (maybe the text “E” or an edit icon, it’s up to you).  When the user clicks on the edit link, the item text should be put into the input text box and the form button text should become “edit”.  The user should be able to modify the text in the input text box and click on the “edit” button.  After clicking the “edit” button, the item in the list should be updated to reflect the modified text in the input text box, and the form should return to contain a blank input text box and an “add” button.
